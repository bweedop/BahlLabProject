# 2019-08-22 - Project Overview

This project is taking place over a six week rotation in the Bahl Lab. The focus of the lab is phylodynamics (how the viral phylogenies are shaped by epidemiology, immunodynamics, and evolutionary processes alone or by some interaction (Grenfell et al. 2004; Volz et al. 2013)).

Phylodynamics is a diverse field that is moving quickly. Similar to many fields of study today, one can get lost quickly in the chaos. I tried to get specific, keep it simple (given a the limited time of six weeks) but yet have some fun (why not, right?). After reading through some literature, my interests centered around interhost transmission.

My hope here is to simply gain familiarity with analysing interhost transmission dynamics.
