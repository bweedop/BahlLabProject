This is a skeleton repository for any sort of research. I developed this in order to build some sort of systematic approach for initiating a research project. There isn't much here but that should change as the research develops.

There are three important folders here:

1. `src` - All source code used during research should be going here.
2. `data` - All data generated or simulated during research should be going here.
3. `notebook` - All notes during the research process should be going here. This should be used very much like a lab notebook that you have on the bench. Take notes on why you are doing things a certain way, problems that you are having, and any other details that should be documented to reduce confusion later on.
